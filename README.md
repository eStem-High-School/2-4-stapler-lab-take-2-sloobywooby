# Stapler-Lab
# INTRODUCTION: 
You have been given a **Stapler** class ```Stapler.java``` and **Stapler** test program ```Main.class```. The Tester program is complete and you are not allowed to change it. The ```Stapler.java``` file is missing code in various places. 

## <span style="color:green">***THE LAWS OF THE JAVA STAPLER:*** </span>

• There are 3 ways to create **Stapler**s, “default” **Stapler**s, “regular” **Stapler**s, and “copy” **Stapler**s. 
• A **Stapler** must be already closed to staple!

• A **Stapler** must be already open to add more staples!

• A **Stapler** only staples something if it already has staples in it!

• Staples can only be added up to the capacity of a **Stapler**!

• If asked to add too many staples, add just enough to fill the **Stapler**!

## <span style="color:skyBlue">DIRECTIONS:</span>
You will need to “fix” the ```Stapler.java``` class so that it will work correctly. 
1. First, fix the 3 constructors.
2. Then fix the **4 mutator** methods (methods that modify something)
3. Finally, fix the **3 accessor** methods (methods that just return a variable). 
4. Once fixed, run the program to make sure it works. 

## <span style="color:skyBlue">Reminders </span> 
• You ***MAY NOT*** change any code in the “tester” program.

• You ***MAY NOT*** add any additional identifiers or variables. You may ***only*** use the three existing instance variables in the ```Stapler.java``` file.

• You ***SHOULD*** add other code, including if statements where necessary to the ```Stapler.java``` file.
